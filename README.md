# tabunder
javascript for tabunder with SE based workaround for firefox block.  
This will be used in one of our upcoming tools but for now feel free to play with it yourself.
  
# usage
simply clone the repo and add the files to your webserver then add your html to the body of template.html

# workaround
firefox blocks popups but another click is enough to circumvent that.   
so we made our own popup that when clicked will trigger the tabunder
